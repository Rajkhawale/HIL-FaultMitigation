# HIL-FaultMitigation

Welcome to the **HIL-FaultMitigation** repository: Code to perform Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) activities on engines using INCA and PUMA data acquisition systems. 

We use the HIL system for the fault mitigation of a pressure shift fault on a 7.6-liter Navistar diesel engine. The code primarily includes reading the engine data coming from INCA and PUMA, preprocessing it, incorporating the controller to maintain torque profile or mitigate faults, and, at last writing the engine inputs into ECU.
