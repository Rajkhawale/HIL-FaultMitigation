# HIL-FaultMitigation

Welcome to the **HIL-FaultMitigation** repository: Code to perform Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) activities on engines using INCA and PUMA data acquisition systems. 

We use the HIL system to mitigate pressure shift faults on a 7.6-liter Navistar diesel engine. The code primarily involves reading engine data from the data acquisition system, preprocessing it, implementing the controller to maintain torque profiles or mitigate faults, and finally, writing the engine inputs to the ECU.
